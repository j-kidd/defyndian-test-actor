# defyndian-test-actor

This project is a basic demo of an Actor node in the Defyndian system. It listens for messages addressed
to it and logs them; it is used to test a new system/feature and debug issues (firewalls, configuration etc.)

The [defyndian-core project](https://www.github.com/j-kidd/defyndian-core) is required and must be installed (gradle install in the project dir) on the box.
